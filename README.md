# shopping_list
mobile application to make your shopping list

This shopping list application is a mobile application made in react native to make your shopping list you can add food by writing the name of the food and clicking on add and delete food by simply clicking on it.


To simulate this mobile application on the windows PC, I used android studio as a mobile emulator. 
I used the Expo framework to generate the application and to test it in real time on my smartphone, (after installing the Expo app, I just had to scan the QR Code generated by expo to test it) . I also used the Expo platform to publish the mobile application once it was finished.

To make this application I used the documentation of react native here https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started
I also used the Expo documentation there https://docs.expo.io/
